/**
 * UINibWrapper allows you to nest nib files inside other nib files.
 *
 * To use UINibWrapper you must:
 *   1. In your parent nib file you must add a blank UIView and change the class type to UINibWrapper.
 *   2. In the "User Defined Runtime Attributes" tab, add an entry for the keyPath "nibName" of type String with the name of your view nib file.
 *   3. If you, optionally, have created a subview class, your subclass name must have the same name as your nested nib file name.
 *
 * And voil√†, you are nesting nib files inside other nib files! Then, you can use the method "-contentView" to retrieve the nested view instance.
 *
 * @discussion By using UINibWrapper, you are adding an extra UIView in your nested views (the UINibWrapper itself).
